            <p>4-5 years ago when I started learning SQL then I got a course in which the Creator directly started
                teaching how to
                select columns from the table and all.
                So, I got confuse because If I don't know
                what is database ?
                what is a table ?
                how to create a database ?
                how to create a table ?
                why there is a need of SQL ?
                how to remove a table from database ?

                Then how directly I can learn select particular columns from Database .
                That is why me and I my team has created a complete SQL series which is so much easy that a child can
                also understand .
